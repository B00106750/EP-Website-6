		The idea of introducing Technological Universities came upon in 2011, as part of the Higher Education eco-system in Ireland. Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and Institute of Technology Tallaght responded by creating the Technological University of Dublin Alliance. The objective of that Alliance was to develop a programme of partnership with the objective of seeking the TU designation.
